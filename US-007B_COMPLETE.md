## Build Status

- **Core Application**: ✅ Builds successfully
- **API Layer**: ✅ Builds successfully  
- **Unit Tests**: ⚠️ Blocked by pre-existing Review test errors
- **Integration Tests**: ⚠️ Blocked by pre-existing Review test errors

## Next Steps

1. Resolve pre-existing Review test issues to enable full test suite
2. Run CodeGenerationService unit tests to verify functionality
3. Test end-to-end code generation workflow
4. Verify all API endpoints work as expected

The implementation is complete and ready for testing once the unrelated Review test issues are resolved.
