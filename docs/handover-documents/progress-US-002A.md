# AI Project Orchestrator - Development Progress & Handover (Updated)

## Developer Context & Ultimate Goal

**Primary Developer Profile**: Senior .NET developer (15+ years). Currently rebuilding systematic code evaluation skills that have atrophied due to heavy AI assistant dependency (primarily Cline with Qwen3-coder).

**Core Challenge**: Developer has become "too lazy to analyze code" and trusts AI output blindly. This creates vulnerability for senior developer interviews where code evaluation skills are critical.

**Ultimate Vision**: Build an AI Project Orchestrator that transforms high-level ideas into working code while serving as a learning vehicle to rebuild systematic code evaluation skills through structured AI collaboration.

### Dual-Purpose Learning Strategy
1. **Interview Preparation**: Practice evaluating AI-generated enterprise patterns and architectural decisions (3-4 month timeline)
2. **Prompt Engineering Mastery**: Discover optimal ways to interact with AI coding agents and eliminate 80% of manual prompt engineering

**Communication Style Requirements**: Direct, honest feedback without flattery. Objective analysis over encouragement. Push critical thinking whenever possible. Structure responses like consultant reports with clear categories.

## Project Vision & Architecture

### Core Value Proposition
Automate the journey from brainstorming to working code through intelligent orchestration of AI models, solving the "which AI model for which task" decision problem with systematic workflows.

### Target Pipeline Flow
```

Human Approval → Structured feedback loops at each stage
```

## Development Philosophy & Patterns

### Code Evaluation Learning Approach
**Critical Assessment Framework**: Each AI-generated component must be systematically reviewed for:
1. **Interface Design**: Single responsibility, clear contracts, appropriate async patterns
2. **HTTP Client Management**: Proper IHttpClientFactory usage, timeout configuration, resource disposal  
3. **Dependency Injection**: Correct lifetime management, proper abstraction boundaries
4. **Clean Architecture**: Layer separation, dependency flow rules, domain isolation
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception hierarchy, meaningful messages, structured logging
6. **Performance**: Memory efficiency, connection reuse, concurrent request handling
7. **Security**: API key handling, input validation, secure communication

### Quality Gates & Human-in-the-Loop
- **Never trust AI-generated code** without systematic architectural review
- **Each pipeline stage** requires human approval before progression
- **Build evaluation checklists** for consistent enterprise pattern recognition
- **Practice background processing** evaluation (async patterns, cancellation tokens)
- **Focus on architectural decisions** and implementation pattern quality

### Incremental Development Strategy
**Core Principle**: Start with minimal working functionality, test thoroughly, then iterate
1. **Always examine working code first** before making changes
2. **Ask clarifying questions** about specific requirements
3. **Make smallest possible changes** to add new functionality  
4. **Test between each step** to ensure nothing breaks
5. **Only modify what's necessary** - avoid rewriting working components

## Pending User Stories (Next Implementation Phase)

### US-003A: Simple Output Review API (Next Priority)
**Objective**: Create basic human-in-the-loop workflow for AI output approval
**Scope**: REST API endpoints for submitting, reviewing, and approving AI outputs
**Key Requirements**:
- POST `/api/review/submit` - Submit AI output for human review
- GET `/api/review/{id}` - Retrieve pending review with full context
- POST `/api/review/{id}/approve` - Approve output and proceed to next stage
- POST `/api/review/{id}/reject` - Reject with feedback for improvement
- In-memory storage only (no database complexity initially)
- Basic workflow state management (pending, approved, rejected)
- Integration with existing logging and correlation ID system

### Epic 2: Requirements → Stories Pipeline (Future Implementation)
- **US-004: Requirements Analysis Service** - Claude-powered analysis of high-level project ideas using RequirementsAnalyst.md instructions
- **US-005: Project Planning Service** - Roadmap and milestone generation using ProjectPlanner.md instructions  
- **US-006: Story Generation Service** - User story creation with acceptance criteria using StoryGenerator.md instructions

### Epic 3: Implementation Pipeline (Advanced Features)
- **US-007: Code Generation Service** - TDD-driven implementation using optimal model routing
- **US-008: Context Management Service** - Smart context optimization and compression for AI calls
- **US-009: Model Intelligence Service** - Performance tracking and optimal routing decisions

## AI Integration Architecture (Designed but Not Implemented)

### Sub-Agent Instruction System
**File Structure** (Instructions/ directory):
- `RequirementsAnalyst.md` - Business analysis specialist (~1000+ words with role, task, constraints, examples)
- `ProjectPlanner.md` - Technical project planning expert
- `StoryGenerator.md` - User story creation specialist  
- `CodeReviewer.md` - Quality assessment expert
- `ArchitecturalGuide.md` - System design advisor

**Integration Pattern**: Each AI service loads its instruction file via `IInstructionService`, uses content as system message in AI calls, with intelligent caching based on file modification times.

### Model Routing Strategy (Planned)
- **Claude Sonnet**: Planning, requirements analysis, user story generation (higher-level reasoning)
- **Qwen3-coder**: Code generation, technical implementation (specialized coding)
- **DeepSeek**: Alternative coding model for comparison/validation
- **Intelligent Selection**: Based on task type, historical performance metrics, provider availability

### Context Management Strategy (Planned)
- Automatic context compression to maintain <40% token window utilization
- Smart summarization of previous pipeline stages for context continuity
- External file storage for large context documents
- Context relevance scoring and filtering for optimal prompt engineering
