# AI Project Orchestrator - Development Progress & Complete Handover

## Developer Context & Ultimate Vision

**Primary Developer Profile**: Senior .NET developer (15+ years) working at university with Canvas LMS API access. Core objective is mastering prompt and context engineering by discovering optimal interaction patterns with AI coding agents, while simultaneously rebuilding systematic code evaluation skills that have deteriorated from AI dependency.

**Learning Challenge**: Developer has become "too lazy to analyze code" and blindly trusts AI outputs. This creates interview vulnerability where systematic code evaluation is critical for senior positions.

**Communication Requirements**: 
- Direct, honest feedback without flattery or praise
- Structured consultant-style responses with clear categories
- Push critical thinking opportunities when available
- Objective analysis over encouragement
- Focus on architectural decision-making and enterprise patterns

**Development Philosophy**: 
- Make smallest possible changes to add functionality
- Always examine working code first before modifications
- Test thoroughly between each implementation step
- Only modify what's necessary - avoid rewriting working components
- Prioritize learning opportunities that advance senior developer skills

## Ultimate Goal & Vision
