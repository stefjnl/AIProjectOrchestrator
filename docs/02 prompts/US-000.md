## Implementation Prompt for US-000: Development Environment Setup

**Role**: You are a senior .NET architect specializing in Clean Architecture and containerized applications.

**Task**: Create a complete development environment for "AIProjectOrchestrator" - a .NET 9 Web API that will orchestrate AI coding workflows.

**Project Structure Requirements:**

```
AIProjectOrchestrator/
├── src/
│   ├── AIProjectOrchestrator.API/           # Web API layer
│   ├── AIProjectOrchestrator.Application/   # Business logic, services
│   ├── AIProjectOrchestrator.Domain/        # Domain entities, interfaces
│   └── AIProjectOrchestrator.Infrastructure/ # Data access, external APIs
├── tests/
│   ├── AIProjectOrchestrator.UnitTests/
│   └── AIProjectOrchestrator.IntegrationTests/
├── docs/                                    # Documentation folder
│   ├── user-stories/                        # User stories and requirements
│   ├── architecture/                        # Architecture decisions, diagrams
│   └── setup/                               # Setup and deployment guides
├── Dockerfile                               # Multi-stage .NET 9 API build
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .github/workflows/
└── README.md
```

**Technical Requirements:**

- .NET 9 Web API with Clean Architecture
- PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core
- Docker & docker-compose with PostgreSQL service included
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD (triggers: push to main, PR creation)
- Proper .gitignore for .NET projects
- Health checks endpoint
- Basic logging with Serilog
- Configuration management with appsettings.json

**Deliverables:**

1. Complete solution structure with all projects
2. The solution builds without errors or warnings
3. Dockerfile for the API (multi-stage .NET 9 build)
4. docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL dependency
5. GitHub Actions workflow file
6. README.md with setup instructions
7. Basic API controller with health check
8. DbContext setup (can be empty for now)
9. Create initial documentation structure in `/docs` with placeholder files for user stories and architecture decisions

**Constraints:**

- Keep dependencies minimal for now (we'll add more later)
- Ensure the solution builds and runs locally
- Include clear setup instructions in README
- Ensure the Dockerfile is NOT ignored by .gitignore (remove or modify any patterns that would exclude it)
- Ensure docker-compose.yml correctly references the Dockerfile in the build context

**File System Setup:**

- You are running from `C:\git` directory
- Create the solution directly in `C:\git\AIProjectOrchestrator\` (no nested AIProjectOrchestrator folders)
- Use `dotnet new sln -n AIProjectOrchestrator` in the root folder, not in a subfolder
- Ensure the .sln file is located at `C:\git\AIProjectOrchestrator\AIProjectOrchestrator.sln`
  
**Verification:**

- Final structure should be: `C:\git\AIProjectOrchestrator\src\AIProjectOrchestrator.API\`
- NOT: `C:\git\AIProjectOrchestrator\AIProjectOrchestrator\src\...`

**Create the complete project structure and all necessary files to get a developer up and running quickly.**
