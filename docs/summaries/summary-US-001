  Summary of Implementation of the Service Configuration System as specified in US-001:

  I've successfully implemented the Service Configuration System for the AI Project Orchestrator, which allows AI services to dynamically load instruction files without requiring container restarts.

  Key Components Created

   1. Domain Layer
      - IInstructionService interface with methods for loading and validating instructions
      - InstructionContent model class to encapsulate instruction data

   2. Application Layer
      - InstructionService implementation with:
        - Dynamic loading of instruction files based on service names
        - Intelligent caching based on file modification times
        - Content validation (minimum length, required sections, UTF-8 encoding)
        - Proper error handling and logging

   3. Configuration
      - InstructionSettings class for configuration binding
      - Updated appsettings.json with instruction service configuration
      - Registered service in DI container as a Singleton

   4. Instruction Files
      - Created Instructions directory with .gitkeep file
      - Added sample RequirementsAnalyst.md with realistic content

   5. Testing
      - Unit tests covering instruction loading, validation, and error scenarios
      - Integration tests for DI registration and end-to-end workflow

  Key Features Implemented

   1. Service Name Mapping
      - Converts service names to file names using convention:
        - RequirementsAnalysisService → RequirementsAnalyst.md
        - ProjectPlanningService → ProjectPlanner.md
        - StoryGenerationService → StoryGenerator.md

   2. Intelligent Caching
      - In-memory caching using ConcurrentDictionary
      - Automatic cache invalidation when files are modified
      - File modification time checking for efficient cache validation

   3. Content Validation
      - Minimum content length requirement (100 characters)
      - Required sections check (Role, Task, Constraints)
      - UTF-8 encoding validation

   4. Error Handling
      - Custom exception handling for missing files and I/O errors
      - Meaningful error messages for different failure scenarios
      - Graceful degradation when files are missing or invalid

   5. Configuration
      - Fully configurable through appsettings.json
      - Configurable instruction directory path, cache timeout, required sections, and minimum content length

  Technical Improvements

   1. Clean Architecture Compliance
      - Proper separation of concerns across Domain, Application, and API layers
      - No file I/O operations in the Domain layer
      - Interface-based design following dependency inversion principle

   2. Performance Optimizations
      - Asynchronous file operations throughout
      - Efficient caching strategy to minimize file system access
      - Lightweight file modification time checking

   3. Code Quality
      - Comprehensive unit test coverage (8+ tests)
      - Proper nullability handling
      - Structured logging with ILogger
      - Following existing project conventions and patterns

   4. Maintainability
      - Clear, well-documented code
      - Consistent naming conventions
      - Configuration-driven behavior
      - Extensible design for future enhancements

  The implementation satisfies all requirements in US-001 and provides a solid foundation for the AI Project Orchestrator's instruction management system. The service is ready for integration with other
  components in the system.
