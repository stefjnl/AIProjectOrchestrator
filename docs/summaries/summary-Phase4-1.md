  I've successfully implemented Phase 4: AI Prompting - Phase 1 Foundation for the AI Project Orchestrator. Here's what was accomplished:

  Domain Layer Implementation
   1. PromptGenerationRequest Model: Created in Domain/Models/PromptGeneration/ with properties for StoryId, TechnicalPreferences, and PromptStyle
   2. PromptGenerationResponse Model: Created with properties for PromptId, GeneratedPrompt, ReviewId, Status, and CreatedAt
   3. PromptGenerationStatus Enum: Created with values Processing, PendingReview, Approved, Rejected, and Failed

  Service Layer Implementation
   4. IPromptGenerationService Interface: Created in Domain/Services/ with methods for GeneratePromptAsync, GetPromptStatusAsync, and CanGeneratePromptAsync
   5. PromptGenerationService Implementation: Created in Application/Services/ with:
      - In-memory storage using ConcurrentDictionary
      - Proper async/await patterns with CancellationToken support
      - Logging integration
      - Placeholder implementation for future prompt generation logic

  Integration
   6. Service Registration: Registered the new service in Program.cs using the same pattern as other services

  Testing
   7. Unit Tests: Created comprehensive unit tests in tests/AIProjectOrchestrator.UnitTests/PromptGeneration/ covering:
      - Successful prompt generation
      - Status retrieval
      - Permission checking
      - Cancellation token handling

  Verification
   - All new unit tests pass
   - Solution builds successfully with no errors (only warnings that were already present)
   - The implementation follows the exact patterns from existing services in the codebase
   - Clean Architecture principles are maintained with proper separation of concerns

  The foundation is now in place and ready for Phase 2, where we'll implement the actual story retrieval integration and prompt generation logic. The service is fully functional with placeholder responses and can be
  extended with the business logic in subsequent phases.
