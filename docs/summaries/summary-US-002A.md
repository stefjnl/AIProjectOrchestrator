I have successfully implemented the multi-provider AI client interface for the AI Project Orchestrator according to the requirements. Here's what was accomplished:

  Domain Layer Implementation
   1. Created AIRequest and AIResponse models in src/AIProjectOrchestrator.Domain\Models\AI\
   2. Implemented custom exception classes (AIProviderException, AIRateLimitException, AITimeoutException) in src/AIProjectOrchestrator.Domain\Exceptions\
   3. Defined the IAIClient interface in src/AIProjectOrchestrator.Domain\Services\
   4. Created IAIClientFactory interface for resolving specific clients

  Application Layer Configuration
   1. Moved configuration models to src/AIProjectOrchestrator.Domain\Configuration\ to avoid circular dependencies:
      - AIProviderSettings with provider-specific settings for Claude, LM Studio, and OpenRouter
      - InstructionSettings (moved from Application layer)

  Infrastructure Layer Implementation
   1. Created abstract BaseAIClient with shared functionality:
      - HTTP client handling with IHttpClientFactory
      - Retry logic with exponential backoff
      - Common logging patterns
   2. Implemented concrete clients for each provider:
      - ClaudeClient - Handles Anthropic API format
      - LMStudioClient - Handles OpenAI-compatible local endpoint calls
      - OpenRouterClient - Handles OpenAI format with provider routing
   3. Created AIClientFactory implementation for resolving specific clients

  API Layer Integration
   1. Updated Program.cs to register:
      - AI provider settings configuration
      - HTTP clients for each provider with proper timeouts
      - AI clients as singletons
      - AI client factory
      - Health checks for all providers
   2. Added configuration to appsettings.json and appsettings.Development.json
   3. Created AITestController for manual testing of AI clients
   4. Implemented health checks for all AI providers

  Testing
   1. Created unit tests for:
      - AI models (AIRequest, AIResponse)
      - Exception classes
      - AI client factory
   2. Created integration tests for health checks
   3. All tests pass successfully

  Project Structure Updates
   1. Resolved circular dependencies between projects
   2. Added necessary package references
   3. Updated project references to ensure proper dependency flow

  The implementation follows Clean Architecture principles with a clear separation of concerns:
   - Domain layer contains models, interfaces, and exceptions
   - Application layer contains business logic (InstructionService)
   - Infrastructure layer contains implementation details (AI clients)
   - API layer contains presentation logic and dependency injection setup

  All AI clients are registered in the DI container and can be resolved either individually or through the factory pattern. The implementation includes proper error handling, retry logic, and health checks for
  production readiness.
