I've verified that all the requirements described in the document have been implemented:

  1. ✅ API Controller Implementation
   - File: src/AIProjectOrchestrator.API/Controllers/PromptGenerationController.cs
   - All required endpoints are implemented:
     - POST /api/prompts/generate
     - GET /api/prompts/{promptId}/status
     - GET /api/prompts/can-generate/{storyGenerationId}/{storyIndex}
     - GET /api/prompts/{promptId}
   - Error handling follows the specified requirements with proper HTTP status codes
   - Follows existing patterns from other controllers with constructor dependency injection and structured logging

  2. ✅ Integration Testing
   - File: tests/AIProjectOrchestrator.IntegrationTests/PromptGenerationIntegrationTests.cs
   - All required tests are implemented:
     - GeneratePrompt_ValidRequest_ReturnsSuccess()
     - GeneratePrompt_InvalidStoryGenerationId_ReturnsBadRequest()
     - GeneratePrompt_UnapprovedStories_ReturnsConflict()
     - GetPromptStatus_ValidId_ReturnsStatus()
     - GetPromptStatus_InvalidId_ReturnsNotFound()
     - CanGeneratePrompt_ValidPrerequisites_ReturnsTrue()
     - CanGeneratePrompt_InvalidPrerequisites_ReturnsFalse()
     - GetPrompt_ValidId_ReturnsPromptDetails()
   - Uses WebApplicationFactory for full HTTP integration testing
   - Mocks external dependencies appropriately

  3. ✅ End-to-End Workflow Testing
   - File: tests/AIProjectOrchestrator.IntegrationTests/CompleteWorkflowIntegrationTests.cs
   - Contains the CompleteWorkflow_ProjectToPrompts_Success() test that validates the complete pipeline
   - Tests the end-to-end workflow from project creation to prompt generation
   - Verifies that the generated prompt contains expected sections

  4. ✅ Service Registration
   - File: src/AIProjectOrchestrator.API/Program.cs
   - All required services are properly registered:
     - IPromptGenerationService as scoped service
     - PromptContextAssembler as scoped service
     - ContextOptimizer as scoped service

  5. ✅ Model Validation
   - Files: Domain models in src/AIProjectOrchestrator.Domain/Models/PromptGeneration/
   - PromptGenerationRequest has proper validation attributes:
     - [Required] for StoryGenerationId
     - [Required] and [Range] for StoryIndex
   - Error messages are properly defined

  All requirements from the document have been successfully implemented with comprehensive testing coverage. The implementation follows .NET Clean Architecture patterns and maintains consistency with existing code
  in the project.
