  Summary

  I've successfully implemented Phase 4: AI Prompting - Phase 2 Story Retrieval Integration for the AI Project Orchestrator. Here's what was accomplished:

  1. Extended Story Generation Service
   - Updated UserStory Model: Added Id, StoryPoints, and Tags properties to the UserStory model
   - Extended IStoryGenerationService Interface: Added three new methods:
     - GetIndividualStoryAsync: Retrieves a specific story by index
     - GetAllStoriesAsync: Retrieves all stories for a generation
     - GetStoryCountAsync: Gets the total number of stories in a generation
   - Implemented New Methods: Added implementations in StoryGenerationService for the new interface methods

  2. Enhanced Prompt Generation Service
   - Updated Dependencies: Modified PromptGenerationService to depend on IStoryGenerationService and IInstructionService
   - Modified Request Model: Updated PromptGenerationRequest to use StoryGenerationId and StoryIndex instead of just StoryId
   - Implemented Prerequisite Validation: Added validation logic to ensure stories are approved before prompt generation
   - Enhanced Error Handling: Added custom exceptions for various error conditions

  3. Created Supporting Components
   - Custom Exceptions: Created StoryNotApprovedException, StoryNotFoundException, and InvalidStoryGenerationException
   - PromptPrerequisiteValidator: Created a static class for validation logic
   - Updated Unit Tests: Enhanced tests for PromptGenerationService and added new tests for StoryGenerationService

  4. Technical Implementation Details
   - Follows Clean Architecture: Maintained separation of concerns with proper dependency injection
   - Async/Await Pattern: Used proper async/await patterns with CancellationToken support
   - Error Handling: Implemented comprehensive error handling with meaningful exception messages
   - Logging: Added appropriate logging for debugging and monitoring

  5. Validation
   - Build Success: Solution builds successfully with no errors (only existing warnings)
   - Unit Tests: All new tests pass, demonstrating the functionality works correctly
   - Integration Ready: Implementation is ready for integration with existing services

  The implementation now allows the PromptGenerationService to:
   1. Access individual user stories from approved story generations
   2. Validate that stories are approved before generating prompts
   3. Retrieve specific stories by index for targeted prompt generation
   4. Handle error conditions gracefully with custom exceptions

  This sets the foundation for Phase 3, where the actual AI-powered prompt generation logic will be implemented.
