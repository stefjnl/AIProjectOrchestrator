# SSL Certificate Validation

**Issue**: SSL Certificate Bypass (Critical Security)  
## Problem Description

### Vulnerability
The application had **complete SSL certificate validation bypass** for all HTTP clients, making it vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. This was a **Critical severity security issue**.

### Affected Components
All 5 HttpClient configurations in `Program.cs`:
1. **ClaudeClient** (line 199)
2. **LMStudioClient** (line 216)
3. **OpenRouterClient** (line 235)
4. **NanoGptClient** (line 252)
5. **DockerAIClient** (line 263)

### Previous Code
```csharp
// ❌ SECURITY RISK: Complete SSL bypass in ALL environments
.ConfigurePrimaryHttpMessageHandler(() => new HttpClientHandler
{
    ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = (message, cert, chain, errors) => true,
    // ... other settings
});
```

### Security Impact
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Production traffic vulnerable to MITM attacks
- ⚠️ **HIGH**: API keys and sensitive data could be intercepted
- ⚠️ **HIGH**: No certificate validation = trust any certificate (including attacker's)
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM**: Compliance violations (PCI DSS, SOC 2, etc. require proper TLS validation)

## Solution Implemented

### Environment-Based SSL Validation

Implemented **conditional SSL validation** based on environment:

```csharp
// ✅ SECURE: Environment-aware SSL validation
.ConfigurePrimaryHttpMessageHandler(() => 
{
    var handler = new HttpClientHandler
    {
        SslProtocols = System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols.Tls12 | 
                      System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols.Tls13,
        UseCookies = false,
        UseProxy = false
    };

    // Only bypass SSL validation in Development for testing
    if (builder.Environment.IsDevelopment())
    {
        handler.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = 
            HttpClientHandler.DangerousAcceptAnyServerCertificateValidator;
        Log.Warning("SSL certificate validation disabled - DEVELOPMENT ONLY");
    }
    // In production, use proper SSL validation (default behavior)

    return handler;
});
```

### Security Features

#### 1. **Development Environment**
- SSL bypass **ONLY** allowed in Development
- Uses `HttpClientHandler.DangerousAcceptAnyServerCertificateValidator`
- Logs warning message for visibility
- Necessary for local services (LMStudio, NanoGpt proxy) using self-signed certificates

#### 2. **Production Environment**
- **Full SSL certificate validation** (default HttpClientHandler behavior)
- Validates:
  - Certificate chain of trust
  - Certificate expiration
  - Certificate revocation status
  - Hostname matching
  - Certificate signature validity
- **Zero bypass** - any SSL error will fail the request

#### 3. **DockerAIClient Enhanced Logging**
```csharp
if (builder.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    handler.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = (message, cert, chain, errors) =>
    {
        if (errors != SslPolicyErrors.None)
        {
            Log.Warning("DockerAIClient: SSL validation bypass in Development - Errors: {Errors}", errors);
            if (cert != null)
            {
                Log.Debug("Certificate: {Subject} issued by {Issuer}", cert.Subject, cert.Issuer);
            }
        }
        return true; // Allow bypass in Development only
    };
}
```

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- ✅ `src/AIProjectOrchestrator.API/Program.cs` - All 5 HttpClient configurations

### Specific Changes

#### ClaudeClient
- Added environment check
- Added warning log
- Proper SSL validation in Production

#### LMStudioClient
- Added environment check for local service
- Added context: "(local service)"
- SSL validation enforced in Production

#### OpenRouterClient
- Added environment check
- Added comment: "should NEVER bypass SSL in production"
- Critical for public API security

#### NanoGptClient
- Added environment check for local proxy
- Added context: "(local proxy)"
- SSL validation enforced in Production

#### DockerAIClient
- Added environment check
- Enhanced logging with SSL error details
- Certificate subject/issuer logging
- Replaced Console.WriteLine with structured Serilog

## Verification

### Build Status
```bash
✅ dotnet build --configuration Release
   Build succeeded in 5.9s
```

### Security Checklist
- ✅ SSL validation **enabled** in Production
- ✅ SSL bypass **restricted** to Development only
- ✅ Warning logs for development SSL bypass
- ✅ Proper error handling in DockerAIClient
- ✅ Uses .NET 9 best practices
- ✅ TLS 1.2/1.3 enforced for all clients
- ✅ No compile errors or warnings

## Security Best Practices Applied

### 1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
- SSL bypass granted **only** where needed (Development)
- Production has **zero** bypass capability

### 2. **Defense in Depth**
- Environment-based security controls
- Logging for SSL validation events
- TLS 1.2/1.3 protocol enforcement

### 3. **Secure by Default**
- Default behavior (no callback) = proper SSL validation
- Bypass is **opt-in** via environment check

### 4. **Visibility & Auditability**
- Warning logs for SSL bypass events
- Detailed certificate information in logs
- Clear code comments explaining security decisions

## Deployment Considerations

### Development Environment
```bash
# appsettings.Development.json or Environment Variable
"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
```
- SSL bypass **active**
- Warning logs visible
- Suitable for local development with self-signed certificates

### Production Environment
```bash
# appsettings.Production.json or Environment Variable
"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Production"
```
- SSL bypass **inactive**
- Full certificate validation
- **HTTPS endpoints MUST have valid certificates**

### Testing in Production-like Environment

**IMPORTANT**: Before deploying to production, ensure:
1. ✅ All external APIs have **valid SSL certificates**
2. ✅ OpenRouter endpoint uses **proper HTTPS**
3. ✅ If using LMStudio/NanoGpt in production, configure **valid certificates**
4. ✅ Test with `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production` locally

```bash
# Test Production SSL validation locally
$env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT="Production"
dotnet run --project src/AIProjectOrchestrator.API
```
