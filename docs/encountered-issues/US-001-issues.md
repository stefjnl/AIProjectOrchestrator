  The issue that was causing the GitHub Actions workflow to fail. Here's what was wrong and how I fixed it:

  The Problem
   1. Missing Dockerfile: The GitHub Actions workflow was trying to build a Docker image using docker build -t ai-project-orchestrator ., but there was no Dockerfile in the project root directory.
   2. .gitignore Issue: Even after creating the Dockerfile, it was being ignored by the .gitignore pattern Dockerfile*.

  The Solution
   1. Created a proper Dockerfile: I created a multi-stage Dockerfile for the .NET 9 Web API that follows best practices for containerization.
   2. Fixed .gitignore: I removed the Dockerfile* pattern from .gitignore to ensure the Dockerfile is included in the repository.
   3. Updated documentation: I updated the README.md and progress documentation to reflect the addition of the Dockerfile.
   4. Enhanced the prompt: I updated the US-000 prompt to explicitly include the Dockerfile in the project structure requirements and added constraints to ensure it's not ignored by .gitignore.

  What Was Fixed
   - The Dockerfile is now properly created and included in the repository
   - The GitHub Actions workflow should now be able to build the Docker image successfully
   - Documentation has been updated to reflect the correct project structure
   - The prompt has been improved to prevent this issue from happening again

  Verification
   - I tested the Dockerfile locally and confirmed it builds successfully
   - I verified that the docker-compose setup works correctly
   - I confirmed that the API health check endpoint responds properly
   - All changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub

  The GitHub Actions workflow should now run successfully since the Dockerfile is present in the repository and properly configured

     1. Fixed the Docker image tagging error: The problem was that we were using ${{ github.repository }} which includes both the owner and repository name (stefjnl/AIProjectOrchestrator), creating an invalid
      Docker image reference. I changed it to use ${{ github.repository_owner }} which only uses the owner name.

   2. Suppressed the credential warning: I redirected stderr to /dev/null when running the docker login command to suppress the warning about credentials being stored unencrypted. This is just a warning and
      doesn't affect functionality in the GitHub Actions environment.

  The GitHub Actions workflow should now run successfully without these errors. The changes have been committed and pushed to the repository.

  I've fixed the issue with the GitHub Container Registry permissions. The problem was that we were trying to push to a repository path that requires special permissions.

  Here's what I changed:

   1. Used the docker/login-action: Instead of manually logging in with the docker login command, I used the official Docker login action which handles authentication more reliably.

   2. Simplified the image naming: Instead of trying to push to ghcr.io/stefjnl/AIProjectOrchestrator/ai-project-orchestrator (which has a nested path that requires special permissions), I'm now pushing to
      ghcr.io/stefjnl/ai-project-orchestrator (a simpler path under your user namespace).

   3. Added lowercase conversion: I added a step to ensure the image ID is all lowercase, which is required by Docker registry naming conventions.

   4. Improved error handling: The new approach uses GitHub Actions best practices for Docker operations.

  The workflow should now be able to successfully push the Docker image to GHCR without permission issues. The changes have been committed and pushed to the repository.
