# US-011B: Enhanced Prompt Generation UX

## User Story
**As a** developer using the AI Project Orchestrator  
**I want** advanced prompt management capabilities including batch operations, enhanced viewing, and download functionality  
**So that** I can efficiently manage multiple prompts and easily export them for use with AI coding assistants

## Context
Building on US-011A's core functionality, this story enhances the user experience with sophisticated prompt management features. Users need efficient ways to handle multiple prompts simultaneously and professional-grade viewing/export capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Batch Operations
- [ ] **Generate All Button**: Single button to generate prompts for all remaining (not started) stories
- [ ] **Confirmation Dialog**: Confirm batch generation with count of stories to be processed
- [ ] **Sequential Processing**: Generate prompts one at a time with 1-second delays to prevent system overload
- [ ] **Progress Feedback**: Show progress during batch generation with real-time status updates
- [ ] **Partial Completion**: Handle scenarios where some stories fail during batch processing

### Enhanced Prompt Viewing
- [ ] **Professional Modal**: Full-screen modal overlay for viewing generated prompts with:
  - Clean typography optimized for code content
  - Monospace font family for technical content
  - Syntax highlighting for code sections
  - Scrollable content area for long prompts
- [ ] **Modal Navigation**: Easy close functionality and click-outside-to-close behavior
- [ ] **Content Formatting**: Preserve prompt formatting including headers, bullet points, and code blocks

### Download & Export Functionality
- [ ] **Individual Download**: Download single prompts as `.md` files with meaningful filenames
- [ ] **Bulk Download**: "Download All Approved Prompts" button for batch export
- [ ] **File Naming**: Consistent naming convention: `story-{index}-prompt.md`
- [ ] **Content Preservation**: Maintain all prompt formatting in downloaded files
- [ ] **Browser Compatibility**: Download functionality works across modern browsers

### Technical Preferences
- [ ] **Preferences Form**: Interface for customizing generated prompts with options:
  - Framework selection (ASP.NET Core, Node.js, etc.)
  - Testing framework (xUnit, NUnit, Jest, etc.)
  - Architecture pattern (Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, etc.)
  - Code style preferences
- [ ] **Default Values**: Sensible defaults based on project context
- [ ] **Persistence**: Remember user preferences across sessions

### Advanced Status Management
- [ ] **Visual Progress Indicators**: Enhanced status display with:
  - Color-coded status badges
  - Progress bars for batch operations
  - Loading spinners during generation
  - Success/failure indicators
- [ ] **Status Summary**: Overview showing total prompts (generated, pending, approved)
- [ ] **Refresh Capability**: Manual refresh button to check latest status

### Error Handling & Recovery
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning when individual prompts fail
- [ ] **Retry Mechanisms**: Option to retry failed prompt generations
- [ ] **Detailed Error Messages**: Specific feedback for different failure scenarios
- [ ] **Offline Handling**: Appropriate messaging when backend services are unavailable

## Technical Requirements

### Enhanced Components
- **`PromptModal` Component**: Sophisticated viewing interface with professional styling
- **`BatchOperationsManager`**: Handles concurrent prompt generation with progress tracking
- **`PreferencesForm`**: Technical preferences interface with validation
- **`DownloadManager`**: Handles individual and batch file downloads

### Advanced State Management
- **Progress Tracking**: Track batch operation progress across multiple concurrent requests
- **Preferences Storage**: Persist user preferences in localStorage
- **Error State Management**: Track and display errors per story
- **Cache Management**: Efficient caching of prompt content for viewing/download

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Load prompt content only when needed for viewing
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large prompt content
- **Request Throttling**: Prevent overwhelming backend during batch operations
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking UI during long-running operations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Users can generate prompts for all stories with a single click
- [ ] Professional modal interface displays prompts with proper formatting
- [ ] Individual and batch download functionality works reliably
- [ ] Technical preferences can be set and are applied to generated prompts
- [ ] Progress indicators provide clear feedback during operations
- [ ] Error handling guides users through failure scenarios
- [ ] All download files contain properly formatted prompt content
- [ ] Batch operations handle edge cases (partial failures, network issues)
- [ ] UI remains responsive during concurrent operations
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 14+ concurrent prompt generations

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Modal Implementation Strategy
```javascript
class PromptModal {
    static display(promptData) {
        // Create overlay with escape key handling
        // Professional typography and formatting
        // Copy and download functionality
    }
    
    static close() {
        // Clean removal with fade-out animation
    }
}
```

### Batch Processing Pattern
```javascript
async function generateAllPrompts() {
    const remaining = getUnprocessedStories();
    const progressBar = initializeProgressBar(remaining.length);
    
    for (const story of remaining) {
        try {
            await generateStoryPrompt(story.index);
            progressBar.increment();
        } catch (error) {
            handleStoryError(story, error);
        }
        await delay(1000); // Prevent overwhelming backend
    }
}
```

### Download Implementation
- Use Blob API for file creation
- Support both individual and ZIP bundle downloads
- Maintain consistent file naming across downloads
- Handle browser download limitations gracefully

## Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)
- Real-time collaboration on prompt editing
- Prompt versioning and history
- Integration with external development tools
- Advanced prompt analytics and success metrics
- Template management for reusable prompt patterns
