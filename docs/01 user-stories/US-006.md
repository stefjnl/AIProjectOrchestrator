### Current State Assessment
Your two-stage pipeline (Requirements → Planning) is production-ready with 101/101 tests passing. The established patterns for service orchestration, error handling, and multi-stage integration provide a solid foundation for US-006.

## US-006: Story Generation Service

### User Story
**As a** project manager  
**I want** to generate implementable user stories from approved project plans  
**So that** development teams have clear, actionable work items with defined acceptance criteria

### Context & Dependencies
This service represents the third stage of AI orchestration, creating the most complex dependency chain yet:
- **Requires**: Approved Requirements Analysis (US-004)
- **Requires**: Approved Project Planning (US-005) 
- **Produces**: Collection of implementable user stories with acceptance criteria
- **Integration**: Three-stage context management with token limit considerations

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Core Functionality
- [ ] **Dependency Validation**: Verify both requirements analysis AND project planning are approved before story generation
- [ ] **Context Aggregation**: Combine requirements analysis results + project planning results as AI context
- [ ] **Story Collection Output**: Parse AI response into individual story objects (title, description, acceptance criteria, priority)
- [ ] **Bulk Processing**: Generate multiple user stories in single AI call for efficiency
- [ ] **Integration Pattern**: Follow established service orchestration pattern from US-004/US-005

#### API Interface
- [ ] **POST /api/stories/generate**: Create stories from approved project plan
- [ ] **GET /api/stories/{generationId}/status**: Check story generation status  
- [ ] **GET /api/stories/{generationId}/results**: Retrieve generated stories collection
- [ ] **GET /api/stories/can-generate/{planningId}**: Validate generation prerequisites

#### Data Models
- [ ] **StoryGenerationRequest**: Input with planningId, story preferences, complexity levels
- [ ] **StoryGenerationResponse**: Output with stories collection, review ID, status
- [ ] **UserStory**: Individual story model with title, description, acceptance criteria, priority
- [ ] **StoryGenerationStatus**: Workflow states including dependency validation failures

#### Context Management
- [ ] **Token Limit Monitoring**: Log combined context size (requirements + planning + instructions)
- [ ] **Context Optimization**: Implement intelligent summarization if context exceeds safe limits
- [ ] **Dependency Context**: Retrieve both requirements and planning results for comprehensive context

#### Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: All service methods including dependency validation scenarios
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: API endpoints with mocked dependencies
- [ ] **Context Size Tests**: Verify handling of large combined context scenarios
- [ ] **Parsing Tests**: Validate AI response parsing into individual story objects

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Follow Established Patterns
1. **Service Interface**: `IStoryGenerationService` in Domain layer
2. **Service Implementation**: `StoryGenerationService` in Application layer following US-004/US-005 orchestration pattern
3. **Controller**: `StoriesController` with RESTful endpoints
4. **Models**: Domain models in appropriate folders following existing structure
5. **Tests**: Both unit and integration tests with realistic scenarios

#### TDD Approach Requirements
1. **Start with failing tests** for all acceptance criteria
2. **Test dependency validation** scenarios (missing requirements, unapproved planning)
3. **Test context aggregation** and token limit scenarios  
4. **Test AI response parsing** with realistic story collection responses
5. **Test error scenarios** (AI failures, context too large, parsing failures)

#### Technical Implementation Constraints
- **Extend Requirements/Planning Services**: Add methods to retrieve full results (not just status)
- **Context Size Management**: Monitor total tokens and implement fallback strategies
- **Story Parsing**: Robust parsing of AI responses into structured story collections
- **Three-Stage Dependencies**: Validate entire chain (Requirements → Planning → Stories)

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All tests written first and initially failing
- [ ] `IStoryGenerationService` interface defined with comprehensive methods
- [ ] `StoryGenerationService` implementation following established orchestration pattern
- [ ] `StoriesController` with all required endpoints
- [ ] Domain models for story generation workflow
- [ ] Extended `IRequirementsAnalysisService` and `IProjectPlanningService` with result retrieval methods
- [ ] `StoryGenerator.md` instruction file with comprehensive story generation guidance
- [ ] Context size monitoring and optimization logic
- [ ] All unit tests passing (minimum 10 tests covering core scenarios)
- [ ] All integration tests passing (minimum 5 API endpoint tests)
- [ ] Service registered in DI container with proper dependencies
- [ ] Solution builds without errors and all existing tests continue passing

### Out of Scope
- Individual story editing or modification APIs
- Story prioritization algorithms or advanced sorting
- Integration with external project management tools
- Story template systems or customization frameworks

This represents the most complex service orchestration challenge yet - managing three-stage dependencies while handling potentially large context windows and parsing complex AI responses into structured collections. The TDD approach will ensure robust handling of the multiple failure scenarios inherent in this complexity.
