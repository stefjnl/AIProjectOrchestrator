You're building an AI orchestration system that automates the development pipeline while serving as a learning vehicle to rebuild systematic code evaluation skills for senior developer interviews. 

## Current Foundation Assessment

**What's Working Well:**
- Production-ready Clean Architecture with proper layer separation
- Multi-provider AI client system with enterprise-grade resilience
- Instruction service with dynamic loading and intelligent caching
- Human review workflow with thread-safe in-memory storage
- Comprehensive health monitoring and structured logging

**Architecture Strengths:**
- Proper dependency injection with singleton HTTP clients
- Async-first design with cancellation token support
- Clean separation between domain models and infrastructure
- Correlation ID tracking throughout request lifecycle

## US-004: Requirements Analysis Service

### User Story
**As a** developer  
**I want** to submit high-level project ideas and receive structured requirements analysis  
**So that** I can transform vague concepts into actionable project specifications through AI orchestration

### Context
This represents the first complete end-to-end workflow in the AI orchestration pipeline. It integrates three existing components (instruction loading, AI client calls, human review) into a cohesive service that demonstrates the core value proposition.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Core Workflow Integration
- [ ] **Service Creation**: `RequirementsAnalysisService` in Application layer implementing `IRequirementsAnalysisService`
- [ ] **Instruction Integration**: Load `RequirementsAnalyst.md` using existing `IInstructionService`
- [ ] **AI Integration**: Call Claude API using existing `IAIClient` with loaded instructions
- [ ] **Review Integration**: Submit AI output using existing `IReviewService` for human approval
- [ ] **API Endpoint**: `/api/requirements/analyze` endpoint accepting project descriptions

#### Request/Response Models
- [ ] **Input Model**: `RequirementsAnalysisRequest` with project description, constraints, context
- [ ] **Output Model**: `RequirementsAnalysisResponse` with analysis results, review ID, status
- [ ] **Status Tracking**: Enum for workflow states (Processing, PendingReview, Approved, Rejected)

#### Error Handling & Resilience
- [ ] **AI Provider Failures**: Graceful handling when Claude API unavailable
- [ ] **Instruction Loading Failures**: Fallback behavior when RequirementsAnalyst.md missing
- [ ] **Validation**: Input validation for project descriptions (minimum length, content checks)
- [ ] **Timeout Handling**: Reasonable timeouts for AI API calls with proper cancellation

#### Integration Testing
- [ ] **End-to-End Test**: Submit request → AI processing → review submission → approval workflow
- [ ] **Component Integration**: Verify proper interaction between all three existing services
- [ ] **Error Scenarios**: Test failure paths and fallback behaviors
- [ ] **Performance**: Measure complete workflow timing under normal conditions

### Technical Implementation Strategy

#### Service Layer Design
```csharp
public interface IRequirementsAnalysisService
{
    Task<RequirementsAnalysisResponse> AnalyzeRequirementsAsync(
        RequirementsAnalysisRequest request, 
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    
    Task<RequirementsAnalysisStatus> GetAnalysisStatusAsync(
        Guid analysisId, 
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

#### Orchestration Flow
1. Validate input request (project description, context)
2. Load RequirementsAnalyst.md instructions via `IInstructionService`
3. Combine instructions + project description into AI request
4. Call Claude API via `IAIClient` with proper error handling
5. Submit AI response for human review via `IReviewService`
6. Return analysis response with review ID and pending status

### Definition of Done
- [ ] `IRequirementsAnalysisService` interface in Domain layer
- [ ] `RequirementsAnalysisService` implementation in Application layer
- [ ] Request/response models with proper validation attributes
- [ ] Controller endpoint with standard RESTful patterns
- [ ] Service registration in DI container with proper lifetime
- [ ] Unit tests covering service orchestration logic
- [ ] Integration test demonstrating complete workflow
- [ ] Error handling with meaningful diagnostics
- [ ] Sample `RequirementsAnalyst.md` instruction file created
- [ ] Documentation update showing first complete pipeline stage

### Out of Scope
- Multiple AI provider fallback logic
- Persistent storage of analysis results
- Batch processing of multiple requirements
- Advanced context management or token optimization

### Learning Objectives
- **Service Composition**: Orchestrating multiple existing services into cohesive workflow
- **Async Orchestration**: Managing multiple async operations with proper error handling
- **Enterprise Integration**: Combining domain services with external API calls
- **Workflow State Management**: Tracking multi-stage process completion

### Critical Evaluation Focus
When implementing, systematically assess:
- **Service Lifetime Management**: Is RequirementsAnalysisService properly scoped?
- **Error Propagation**: Do failures provide actionable diagnostic information?
- **Resource Management**: Are HTTP clients and async operations properly disposed?
- **Interface Design**: Does the service contract follow established patterns?

This story transforms your existing infrastructure into the first working AI orchestration workflow, demonstrating the core value while providing rich opportunities for systematic code evaluation practice.
