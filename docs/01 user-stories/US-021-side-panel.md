## User Story: Artifacts Side Panel

### **Primary Story**

**As a** project manager using the AI Project Orchestrator  
**I want** a persistent side panel showing all generated artifacts for the current project  
**So that** I can view requirements analysis, project plans, and other generated content without navigating away from the workflow pipeline

### **Acceptance Criteria**

**Display & Layout**
- [ ] Side panel appears on right side of workflow page (collapsible)
- [ ] Panel shows "Generated Artifacts" header with project name
- [ ] Panel lists all completed artifacts with clear labels and timestamps
- [ ] Panel remains visible across all workflow stages
- [ ] Panel width: ~350px, doesn't interfere with main workflow

**Content Organization** 
- [ ] Artifacts grouped by stage: Requirements Analysis, Project Planning, User Stories, Prompts
- [ ] Each artifact shows: title, completion date, approval status (Approved/Pending/Rejected)
- [ ] Empty states: "No artifacts generated yet" when project has no completed stages

**Interaction Behavior**
- [ ] Click artifact item opens expandable content area within panel
- [ ] Content area shows full generated text with basic formatting
- [ ] Multiple artifacts can be expanded simultaneously
- [ ] Collapse/expand controls for each artifact
- [ ] Panel toggle button: minimize to thin bar, restore to full width

**Technical Integration**
- [ ] Fetch artifacts via existing API endpoints (requirements status, planning status, etc.)
- [ ] Update artifact list when new content is approved in review queue
- [ ] Handle loading states during artifact retrieval
- [ ] Error handling for failed artifact loads

### **Definition of Done**
- [ ] Panel integrates with existing WorkflowManager state tracking
- [ ] All artifact content displays with proper formatting
- [ ] Panel responsive on mobile (converts to bottom sheet)
- [ ] No performance impact on main workflow functionality
- [ ] Works across all project workflow pages

### **Technical Notes**
- Leverage existing API endpoints: `GET /api/requirements/{id}/status`, `GET /api/planning/{id}/status`
- Store panel state in localStorage (open/closed, expanded artifacts)
- Use existing artifact retrieval patterns from review queue implementation

### **Out of Scope**
- Artifact editing capabilities
- Export functionality
- Version history
- Artifact comparison features

This story keeps scope tight while solving your core access problem without disrupting the existing workflow paradigm.
