# US-005: Project Planning Service

## User Story
**As a** developer  
**I want** to transform approved requirements analysis into structured project plans with roadmaps and architecture decisions  
**So that** I can progress from validated requirements to actionable development planning through AI orchestration

## Context
This represents the second stage in the AI orchestration pipeline, building on US-004's foundation. It demonstrates advanced service composition by consuming approved requirements analysis and producing comprehensive project plans. This story introduces context management complexity and multi-stage workflow orchestration patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Workflow Integration
- [ ] **Service Creation**: `ProjectPlanningService` in Application layer implementing `IProjectPlanningService`
- [ ] **Requirements Integration**: Accept approved `RequirementsAnalysisResponse` as input context
- [ ] **Instruction Integration**: Load `ProjectPlanner.md` using existing `IInstructionService`
- [ ] **AI Integration**: Call Claude API with combined requirements + planning instructions
- [ ] **Review Integration**: Submit planning output using existing `IReviewService` for human approval
- [ ] **API Endpoint**: `/api/planning/create` endpoint accepting requirements analysis ID

### Request/Response Models
- [ ] **Input Model**: `ProjectPlanningRequest` with requirements analysis ID, planning preferences, constraints
- [ ] **Output Model**: `ProjectPlanningResponse` with roadmap, architecture decisions, milestones, review ID
- [ ] **Status Tracking**: Enum for planning workflow states (Processing, PendingReview, Approved, Rejected, Failed)
- [ ] **Dependency Validation**: Verify requirements analysis is approved before planning begins

### Advanced Context Management
- [ ] **Requirements Retrieval**: Fetch approved requirements analysis results as planning context
- [ ] **Context Combination**: Merge requirements + planning instructions + user preferences into coherent AI request
- [ ] **Response Parsing**: Structure AI output into roadmap components (phases, milestones, architecture decisions)
- [ ] **Context Preservation**: Maintain traceability from original requirements through to planning output

### Multi-Stage Workflow Handling
- [ ] **Dependency Checking**: Validate that referenced requirements analysis exists and is approved
- [ ] **State Management**: Track planning status independently from requirements status
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Handle scenarios where requirements are modified during planning process
- [ ] **Workflow Coordination**: Proper sequencing of requirements → planning → future stages

### Enhanced Error Handling
- [ ] **Dependency Failures**: Graceful handling when referenced requirements analysis unavailable
- [ ] **Context Size Management**: Handle scenarios where combined context exceeds AI model limits
- [ ] **Planning Complexity**: Manage variable-length AI responses (simple vs. complex project plans)
- [ ] **State Consistency**: Ensure planning workflow doesn't proceed with invalid requirements

### Integration Testing
- [ ] **Multi-Stage Test**: Requirements analysis → approval → project planning → review workflow
- [ ] **Context Validation**: Verify requirements context properly integrated into planning prompts
- [ ] **Error Scenarios**: Test failure paths including missing requirements, unapproved dependencies
- [ ] **Performance**: Measure workflow timing for complex projects with large requirements context

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Service Layer Design
```csharp
public interface IProjectPlanningService
{
    Task<ProjectPlanningResponse> CreateProjectPlanAsync(
        ProjectPlanningRequest request,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    
    Task<ProjectPlanningStatus> GetPlanningStatusAsync(
        Guid planningId,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
        
    Task<bool> CanCreatePlanAsync(
        Guid requirementsAnalysisId,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

### Enhanced Orchestration Flow
1. **Validate Planning Request**: Check required fields, dependency IDs
2. **Verify Dependencies**: Confirm requirements analysis exists and is approved via `IRequirementsAnalysisService`
3. **Load Planning Instructions**: Get `ProjectPlanner.md` via `IInstructionService`
4. **Retrieve Requirements Context**: Fetch approved requirements analysis results
5. **Context Integration**: Combine instructions + requirements + planning preferences
6. **AI Processing**: Call Claude API with comprehensive context, handle larger responses
7. **Response Structuring**: Parse AI output into structured planning components
8. **Review Submission**: Submit structured plan for human review via `IReviewService`
9. **Status Tracking**: Return planning response with review ID and workflow status

### Context Management Requirements
- **Context Size Monitoring**: Track combined token usage, implement compression if needed
- **Context Relevance**: Preserve essential requirements while managing prompt size
- **Response Parsing**: Structure variable AI outputs into consistent planning format
- **Dependency Tracking**: Maintain links between requirements, planning, and future pipeline stages

## Definition of Done
- [ ] `IProjectPlanningService` interface in Domain layer with dependency validation methods
- [ ] `ProjectPlanningService` implementation with multi-stage orchestration logic
- [ ] Request/response models with dependency reference validation
- [ ] Controller endpoint following established REST patterns
- [ ] Service registration in DI container with proper lifetime management
- [ ] Unit tests covering orchestration logic and dependency scenarios
- [ ] Integration test demonstrating requirements → planning workflow
- [ ] Multi-stage error handling with meaningful diagnostics
- [ ] Enhanced `ProjectPlanner.md` instruction file with roadmap format specifications
- [ ] Context size monitoring and management capabilities
- [ ] Documentation showing two-stage pipeline operation

## Out of Scope
- Automated requirements analysis refresh when planning fails
- Parallel planning scenario generation (multiple planning approaches)
- Integration with external project management tools
- Advanced context optimization algorithms
- Planning template selection based on project type

## Learning Objectives
- **Multi-Stage Orchestration**: Managing dependent service workflows with proper error handling
- **Context Management**: Combining multiple data sources into coherent AI prompts
- **Dependency Validation**: Service-to-service integration with state verification
- **Response Processing**: Parsing and structuring variable AI outputs
- **Workflow State Management**: Tracking complex multi-stage process states

## Critical Evaluation Focus
When implementing, systematically assess:
- **Service Dependencies**: How does the service handle missing or invalid requirements?
- **Context Integration**: Is the requirements → planning context combination effective?
- **Error Propagation**: Do dependency failures provide clear diagnostic information?
- **Performance Impact**: How does context size affect AI processing time?
- **State Consistency**: Can the system handle concurrent modifications to dependencies?

## Advanced Technical Challenges

### Context Window Management
- **Challenge**: Combined requirements + instructions + preferences may exceed token limits
- **Learning Opportunity**: Implement intelligent context summarization and compression
- **Implementation Strategy**: Monitor token usage, implement fallback summarization

### Dependency State Management  
- **Challenge**: Requirements analysis could be modified while planning is in progress
- **Learning Opportunity**: Implement dependency versioning and state consistency checks
- **Implementation Strategy**: Snapshot requirements at planning initiation, validate state consistency

### Variable Response Parsing
- **Challenge**: AI planning responses vary significantly in structure and length
- **Learning Opportunity**: Build flexible parsing logic that handles diverse output formats
- **Implementation Strategy**: Define structured output format in instructions, implement tolerant parsing

This story significantly advances the AI orchestration pipeline while introducing sophisticated service composition patterns, context management challenges, and multi-stage workflow coordination - all valuable for senior developer interview preparation.
