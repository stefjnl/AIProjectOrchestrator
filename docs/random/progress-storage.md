Yes, I can create a "summary-postgres.md" file to document our work on the localStorage elimination task. I'll summarize the approach, steps completed, and the current failure state based on the conversation history and project state. Since we're in PLAN MODE, I'll provide the content here, and then you can toggle to ACT MODE to have me implement the file creation and continue the task.

### Summary of Work on Frontend localStorage Elimination & EF Core Migration Validation

#### Overall Approach
The task is to eliminate localStorage usage in the frontend for workflow state management by implementing a backend-driven API endpoint (/api/review/workflow-status/{projectId}) that aggregates the state from the database via EF Core. This involves:
- Backend: Create the WorkflowStateResponse model, update enums to include NotStarted, implement the endpoint in ReviewController to aggregate states from services (RequirementsAnalysis, ProjectPlanning, StoryGeneration, PromptGeneration), add missing methods to service interfaces (e.g., GetAnalysisByProjectAsync), implement those methods in service classes using repositories, and add repository methods (e.g., GetByProjectIdAsync) for querying by project ID.
- Frontend: Refactor WorkflowManager to use the new API instead of localStorage for state persistence, update HTML files to load state from API, remove localStorage calls, add polling for real-time updates.
- EF Core: Validate migrations, add indexes for performance (e.g., on ProjectId, Status), ensure schema supports the new queries.
- General: Ensure all changes follow Clean Architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure layers), handle transactions for approvals, and test the full workflow.

This approach ensures state is server-side, consistent across sessions/devices, and scalable, while maintaining the existing architecture.

#### Steps Completed So Far
1. **Backend Models (Domain/Models)**:
   - Created WorkflowStateResponse.cs with nested states (RequirementsAnalysisState, ProjectPlanningState, StoryGenerationState, PromptGenerationState, StoryPromptState).
   - Updated enums (RequirementsAnalysisStatus, ProjectPlanningStatus, StoryGenerationStatus, PromptGenerationStatus) to include NotStarted = 0 as the default value.
   - Added using statements for correct namespaces (Models, Stories, PromptGeneration).

2. **Backend Endpoint Implementation (API/Controllers/ReviewController.cs)**:
   - Implemented GetWorkflowStatusAsync to aggregate state from services.
   - Added private helper methods (GetRequirementsAnalysisStateAsync, GetProjectPlanningStateAsync, GetStoryGenerationStateAsync, GetPromptGenerationStateAsync) to fetch and map entity states.
   - Fixed issues like Guid parsing for GenerationId and StoryTitle set to empty string.

3. **Service Interfaces (Domain/Services)**:
   - Added missing methods: GetAnalysisByProjectAsync to IRequirementsAnalysisService, GetPlanningByProjectAsync to IProjectPlanningService, GetGenerationByProjectAsync to IStoryGenerationService, GetPromptsByProjectAsync to IPromptGenerationService.

4. **Service Implementations (Application/Services)**:
   - Implemented GetAnalysisByProjectAsync in RequirementsAnalysisService using repository GetByProjectIdAsync.
   - Implemented GetPlanningByProjectAsync in ProjectPlanningService using the new repository method.

5. **Repository Methods (Infrastructure/Repositories)**:
   - Added GetByProjectIdAsync to IProjectPlanningRepository and implemented in ProjectPlanningRepository using EF query on RequirementsAnalysis.ProjectId.

6. **Duplicate Interface Cleanup**:
   - Removed duplicate interfaces from Domain/Interfaces to resolve ambiguity with Domain/Services interfaces.
   - Ensured controller and services use Domain.Services consistently.

7. **Build Verification**:
   - Ran dotnet build multiple times to diagnose and fix compilation errors (e.g., missing using for Entities, property accesses).

The endpoint is now implemented and the build is closer to succeeding, with only 2 errors left (PromptGenerationService and StoryGenerationService implementations for their new methods).

#### Current Failure
The build fails with 2 errors:
- 'PromptGenerationService' does not implement 'IPromptGenerationService.GetPromptsByProjectAsync(int, CancellationToken)'.
- 'StoryGenerationService' does not implement 'IStoryGenerationService.GetGenerationByProjectAsync(int, CancellationToken)'.

These are because the service classes need to implement the new interface methods we added. We need to add implementations for GetPromptsByProjectAsync in PromptGenerationService and GetGenerationByProjectAsync in StoryGenerationService, likely using their repositories to query by project ID through joins.
