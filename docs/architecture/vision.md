# AI Project Orchestrator - Vision Document

## Project Vision
Transform the software development workflow by automating the journey from high-level ideas to working code through intelligent orchestration of AI models and structured development processes.

## Problem Statement
Currently, working with AI coding assistants requires extensive manual effort in:
- Creating detailed prompts for each development task
- Managing context across multiple interactions
- Choosing the optimal AI model for different types of work
- Ensuring consistent quality and architectural standards
- Coordinating between brainstorming, planning, and implementation phases

This leads to inefficient workflows, inconsistent results, and developer fatigue from constant context switching and prompt engineering.

## Solution Overview
The AI Project Orchestrator automates and systematizes the entire development pipeline:

**Input**: High-level project requirements or ideas  
**Output**: Structured user stories, technical specifications, and working code

**Core Pipeline**:
1. **Requirements Analysis** → Extract functional/non-functional requirements
2. **Project Planning** → Generate roadmaps, milestones, and architecture decisions  
3. **Story Generation** → Create implementable user stories with acceptance criteria
4. **Context Engineering** → Automatically gather relevant context and examples
5. **Model Orchestration** → Route tasks to optimal AI models (Claude, Qwen3-Coder, DeepSeek)
6. **Quality Assessment** → Continuous feedback loops with human oversight
7. **Code Generation** → TDD-driven implementation with automated testing

## Success Criteria
- **80% reduction** in manual prompt engineering time
- **Consistent quality** through standardized sub-agent instructions
- **Intelligent model routing** based on task type and historical performance
- **Structured workflow** with clear handoff points and quality gates
- **Context preservation** across the entire development lifecycle

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Single-provider AI model integration (OpenRouter, configured)
- Configurable sub-agent instruction system (RequirementsAnalyst.md, etc.)
- Quality feedback loops at each pipeline stage
- Context document management (~10k character support)
- Test-driven development integration
- Real-time progress tracking and reporting

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: <30 seconds for story generation, <15 seconds for follow-up queries
- **Reliability**: Graceful fallback when AI models are unavailable
- **Scalability**: Handle complex multi-month projects with hundreds of user stories
- **Maintainability**: Clean Architecture with eventual microservices extraction
- **Security**: Local-first processing with secure API key management

## Architecture Principles
1. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with clear dependency boundaries
2. **Eventual Microservices**: Monolith-first approach with extraction-ready design
3. **AI Model Agnostic**: Pluggable interface supporting multiple providers
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Quality gates requiring human approval before progression
5. **Context-Aware**: Intelligent context management and optimization
6. **Test-Driven**: Quality assurance through automated testing at every stage

## Technology Stack
- **.NET 9 Web API**: Core orchestration platform
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API layers
- **Entity Framework Core**: Data persistence with PostgreSQL (not implemented yet)
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment and development
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation

## Future Vision
- **Intelligent Agent Collaboration**: Sub-agents that learn from each other's outputs
- **Performance Analytics**: Model selection optimization based on success metrics
- **Template Marketplace**: Reusable project templates and instruction sets
- **Integration Ecosystem**: Connections to project management tools, IDEs, and deployment platforms

## Development Approach
Start with a monolithic application focusing on the core pipeline (Requirements → Stories → Code), then gradually extract specialized microservices as the system matures. Each component will be designed with clear interfaces to support this evolution.

The initial focus is on creating a robust foundation that demonstrates the core value proposition while establishing patterns for future expansion.
