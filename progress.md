# AI Project Orchestrator - Progress Summary

## Approach Taken
We are working on fixing the AI Project Orchestrator application to properly use OpenRouter instead of the failing Claude provider. The approach involves:
1. First identifying and fixing the instruction loading issues
2. Then replacing Claude with OpenRouter across all AI services
3. Finally fixing any configuration issues with the OpenRouter client

## Steps Completed So Far

### 1. Instruction Loading Fix
- **Issue**: The `GetInstructionFileName` method in `InstructionService.cs` was not properly adding `.md` extensions
- **Fix**: Modified the method to always add the `.md` extension regardless of whether "Service" is in the name
- **Result**: Instructions are now loading successfully (confirmed by "Successfully loaded instruction for service: RequirementsAnalyst" log)

### 2. Claude to OpenRouter Replacement
- **Issue**: Claude provider was failing with "request message already sent" error
- **Fix**: Updated all AI services to use OpenRouter instead of Claude:
  - Updated `RequirementsAnalysisService` to use OpenRouter model names
  - Updated `StoryGenerationService` to use OpenRouter
  - Updated `ProjectPlanningService` to use OpenRouter
  - Updated `CodeGenerationService` to route all requests to OpenRouter
- **Result**: All services now configured to use OpenRouter

### 3. OpenRouter Client Configuration Fix
- **Issue**: OpenRouter client was failing with "invalid request URI" error
- **Fix**: Modified `OpenRouterClient.cs` to use empty path instead of "chat/completions"
- **Result**: HttpClient configuration should now work properly

## Current Failure We're Working On

Despite the fixes above, we're still getting the same error:
```
System.InvalidOperationException: An invalid request URI was provided. Either the request URI must be an absolute URI or BaseAddress must be set.
```

This suggests that the HttpClient configuration is still not properly setting the BaseAddress for the OpenRouter client. The issue appears to be in how the HttpClient is being configured in the DI container or how the OpenRouterClient is accessing it.

## Next Steps
1. Investigate the HttpClient configuration in Program.cs
2. Check if the BaseAddress is actually being set properly
3. Verify the OpenRouter settings are being loaded correctly
4. Test the OpenRouter client configuration
