# AI Project Orchestrator - Implementation Progress

## Current Status
We have successfully implemented a fully functional frontend workflow for the AI Project Orchestrator system. The system guides users through a complete multi-stage AI-assisted software development process:
1. Requirements Analysis
2. Project Planning
3. Story Generation
4. Code Generation

Each stage requires human approval before proceeding to the next stage.

## Approach
Our approach involved:
1. Implementing missing frontend functionality for all workflow stages
2. Creating proper state management to track project progress
3. Ensuring proper orchestration between stages
4. Adding comprehensive error handling and user feedback
5. Creating extensive unit and integration tests for frontend components

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Enhanced API Functions
- Added new API functions in `frontend/js/api.js` for all workflow stages:
  - Project Planning: `createProjectPlan`, `getProjectPlanningStatus`, `canCreateProjectPlan`
  - Story Generation: `generateStories`, `getStoryGenerationStatus`, `canGenerateStories`
  - Code Generation: `generateCode`, `getCodeGenerationStatus`, `canGenerateCode`
- Improved API client to handle various response types including boolean values
- Made all API functions globally available by attaching them to the window object

### 2. Created Workflow State Management
- Implemented `WorkflowManager` class in `frontend/js/workflow.js` to track project state
- Added localStorage persistence for workflow state between sessions
- Created methods to track all workflow stages (requirements, planning, stories, code)

### 3. Implemented Missing Workflow Stages
- Replaced placeholder functions in `frontend/projects/workflow.html`:
  - `startRequirementsAnalysis()` - Analyzes project requirements using AI
  - `startProjectPlanning()` - Creates project plans based on approved requirements
  - `startStoryGeneration()` - Generates user stories based on approved project plans
  - `startCodeGeneration()` - Generates code based on approved user stories
- Added proper error handling and user feedback for each stage

### 4. Added Workflow Orchestration
- Implemented logic to enable/disable workflow stage buttons based on completion status
- Added UI updates to show current status of each stage (Not Started, Pending Review, Approved)
- Created functions to save and load workflow state between sessions

### 5. Created Comprehensive Test Suite
- Created unit tests for the workflow manager in `tests/frontend/workflow.test.js`
- Added API function tests in `tests/frontend/api.test.js`
- Implemented integration tests for complete workflow in `tests/frontend/integration.test.js`
- Created end-to-end workflow tests in `tests/frontend/e2e.test.js`
- Developed test runners and verification tools

### 6. Fixed Function Scope Issues
- Updated all API function calls to explicitly use the window object to ensure availability
- Resolved scope issues that were preventing functions from being called correctly
- Added comprehensive error handling around all API calls

## Files Modified
- `frontend/js/api.js` - Enhanced API functions and improved response handling
- `frontend/js/workflow.js` - Created workflow state management
- `frontend/projects/workflow.html` - Implemented missing workflow stage functions
- `tests/frontend/workflow.test.js` - Created unit tests for workflow manager
- `tests/frontend/api.test.js` - Created unit tests for API functions
- `tests/frontend/integration.test.js` - Created integration tests for complete workflow
- `tests/frontend/e2e.test.js` - Created end-to-end workflow tests
- `tests/frontend/test-runner.js` - Created simple test runner
- `frontend/test-api.html` - Created API function test page
- `frontend/test-functions.html` - Created function availability test page
- `frontend/final-test.html` - Created comprehensive function test page

## Testing Approach
All functionality has been implemented with comprehensive error handling and user feedback. The test suite provides full coverage for:
- Unit testing of individual components
- Integration testing of workflow stages
- End-to-end testing of complete user journeys
- API function availability and correctness

## Verification
The implementation has been thoroughly tested with:
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Integration tests for workflow transitions
- End-to-end tests for complete user workflows
- Manual verification using test HTML pages
- API endpoint verification using direct HTTP requests

The system now provides a complete, functional workflow from project creation through code generation, with proper state management and error handling at each stage.
