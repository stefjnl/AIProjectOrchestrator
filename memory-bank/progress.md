# Progress

## What Works
- Memory Bank initialization: Core files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md) created and populated with foundational content.
- Project structure: Existing .NET solution with Clean Architecture layers in place (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API).
- Docker setup: docker-compose.yml present for containerized development.
- Basic API: Program.cs configured for .NET 9 Web API.

## What's Left to Build
- Domain entities for workflows, phases, artifacts (e.g., Requirement, Plan, UserStory).
- Application services for each phase (RequirementsAnalysisService, ProjectPlanningService, etc.).
- Infrastructure implementations: EF Core DbContext, repositories, AI model clients.
- API controllers for workflow initiation and status.
- Integration tests for end-to-end pipeline.
- AI provider configurations and prompt templates.
- Human approval mechanisms and notifications.

## Current Status
- Documentation: Memory Bank fully initialized; ready for active development.
- Codebase: Skeleton projects exist; no functional workflows yet.
- Testing: Basic unit test projects in place; no tests implemented.
- Deployment: Docker ready but untested for full stack.

## Known Issues
- None identified during initialization.
- Potential: AI API keys and local LM Studio setup for testing.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Confirmed Clean Architecture as core pattern; no deviations.
- .NET 9 selected for latest features; nullable enabled.
- PostgreSQL for persistence; EF Core migrations pending.
- Multi-provider AI: Starting with abstractions; implementations iterative.
- Testing: TDD to be enforced; coverage targets 80%+.
