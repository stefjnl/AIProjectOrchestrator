# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The AI Project Orchestrator addresses the inefficiency in software development workflows where human developers manually coordinate multiple AI models for tasks like analysis, planning, and code generation. It streamlines this by automating the orchestration, allowing developers to focus on high-level decisions rather than repetitive routing.

## Problems It Solves
- **Fragmented AI Usage**: Developers switch between different AI providers (e.g., Claude, local models) without a unified interface.
- **Workflow Bottlenecks**: Manual progression through requirement analysis, planning, story creation, and implementation phases.
- **Lack of Standardization**: Inconsistent prompting and context management across tools.
- **Scalability Issues**: Handling complex projects without automated progress tracking and human intervention points.

## How It Should Work
- **Input**: User provides high-level requirements via API or UI.
- **Phased Processing**: AI models are routed through stages: Requirements Analysis → Project Planning → User Story Generation → Implementation Planning, with optional human review.
- **Multi-Model Routing**: Intelligent selection of AI providers based on task type (e.g., Claude for planning, local models for code gen).
- **Output**: Structured artifacts like plans, stories, and code prompts, stored in a database for persistence and audit.
- **Feedback Loops**: Human approval gates and iterative refinements based on quality checks.

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Intuitive API endpoints and dashboard for monitoring workflows.
- **Transparency**: Real-time progress tracking, logs, and visualizations of AI interactions.
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling, retries, and fallbacks to ensure workflows complete successfully.
- **Extensibility**: Easy integration of new AI providers and custom phases.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Outputs that integrate seamlessly into IDEs and version control systems.
