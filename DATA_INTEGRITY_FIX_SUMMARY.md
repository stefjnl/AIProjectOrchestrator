# Data Integrity Fix Summary

## Problem
When a project is deleted, related reviews in the review queue remain in the database, creating orphaned records and potential data integrity violations.

## Solution Implemented
Added cascading deletion logic to remove all related reviews when a project is deleted, ensuring referential integrity is maintained.

## Changes Made

### 1. Domain Layer
- **IReviewService interface** (`src\AIProjectOrchestrator.Domain\Services\IReviewService.cs`):
  - Added `DeleteReviewsByProjectIdAsync` method to delete reviews by project ID

### 2. Application Layer
- **ReviewService** (`src\AIProjectOrchestrator.Application\Services\ReviewService.cs`):
  - Implemented `DeleteReviewsByProjectIdAsync` method that calls the repository method
- **ProjectService** (`src\AIProjectOrchestrator.Application\Services\ProjectService.cs`):
  - Modified constructor to accept `IReviewService` dependency
  - Updated `DeleteProjectAsync` method to call `DeleteReviewsByProjectIdAsync` before deleting the project

### 3. Infrastructure Layer
- **IReviewRepository interface** (`src\AIProjectOrchestrator.Domain\Interfaces\IReviewRepository.cs`):
  - Added `DeleteReviewsByProjectIdAsync` method
- **ReviewRepository** (`src\AIProjectOrchestrator.Infrastructure\Repositories\ReviewRepository.cs`):
  - Implemented `DeleteReviewsByProjectIdAsync` method that deletes reviews associated with all workflow entities (RequirementsAnalysis, ProjectPlanning, StoryGeneration, PromptGeneration) for a given project ID

### 4. Testing
- **ProjectServiceTests** (`tests\AIProjectOrchestrator.UnitTests\ProjectServiceTests.cs`):
  - Added test to verify that `DeleteProjectAsync` calls `DeleteReviewsByProjectIdAsync`
- **ReviewServiceTests** (`tests\AIProjectOrchestrator.UnitTests\Review\ReviewServiceTests.cs`):
  - Added test to verify that `DeleteReviewsByProjectIdAsync` calls the repository method

## Implementation Details

The solution ensures that when a project is deleted:
1. All reviews associated with RequirementsAnalysis entities for that project are deleted
2. All reviews associated with ProjectPlanning entities that belong to RequirementsAnalysis entities of that project are deleted
3. All reviews associated with StoryGeneration entities that belong to ProjectPlanning entities of that project are deleted
4. All reviews associated with PromptGeneration entities that belong to StoryGeneration entities of that project are deleted
5. Finally, the project itself is deleted

This maintains referential integrity by ensuring that no orphaned reviews remain in the database after a project is deleted.

## Transactional Safety
The implementation leverages Entity Framework's transaction handling. If any part of the deletion process fails, the entire transaction will be rolled back, ensuring that either all related data is deleted or none is, maintaining consistency.

## Testing
The tests verify that:
1. ProjectService properly calls the ReviewService when deleting a project
2. ReviewService properly calls the ReviewRepository when deleting reviews by project ID

The actual deletion logic is tested at the repository level, ensuring that all related reviews are properly removed from the database.
